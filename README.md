# HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset from Kaggle. It includes data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and insights for HR decision-making.

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- EDA (job role, salary, age group)
- Attrition factor analysis
- Feature encoding & scaling
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Evaluation: Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC
- Feature importance ranking

## 📈 Model Performance
- **Random Forest Accuracy: 86%**
- Key factors affecting attrition:
  - Overtime
  - Salary hike %
  - Distance from home
  - Job satisfaction

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
